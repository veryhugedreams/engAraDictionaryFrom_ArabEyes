The translation is not covering all parts of speech.
It should show the meaning as noun and the meaning as verb ...etc.

For example if you search the word can +1

SELECT * FROM engaradictionary.engaradictionary
where upper(eng) = 'CAN';

The result will be as below :

id    | eng |   ara
10890 | Can | يمكن أن

It only cover the meaning as verb but, it should also cover at least the noun meaning علبة
or cover most of the meaning like below :
كأس
صفيجة
علبة
سجن
مدمّرة
يستطيع
يمكن

Can we know which dictionary used to generate this database ?
I highly appreciate all the efforts but we need to make this project perfect and useful.

Thanks.
